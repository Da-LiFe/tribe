# Conan 2.0 Tribe

It's time to move Conan forward with the help and feedback of the community. During
the last years Conan has been successfully adopted by many solo programmers and 
enterprises helping all of to build high-quality applications and improve their 
development experience. Conan needs another leap forward and the 2.0 release will
become the next major and stable release integrating everything learned in these years.

This repository in Github will gather the proposals, substantial features and 
breaking changes that would arrive to Conan 2.0. This aims to be a collaborative
effort among the tribe members and the development team, trying to understand 
the needs, the pains and the implications of every feature or breaking change.

We need to evolve Conan, but we want to do it together.


> Notice this is not the place for new feature requests, ideas or suggestions. This is the place only for important design, architectural decisions that are derived from already existing feedback and experience, and as such, they have been already matured and discussed previously.


The proposal process
--------------------

**A proposal starts with a pull-request to the `design` folder** of this repository
following the guidelines in this [template](design/_TEMPLATE.md). We expect Conan
core development team to initiate most of them (other people starting them are
welcome, but keep in this repository is for substantial changes. If you are not sure
it is probably better to 
[open an issue in Conan repository](https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues)).

This is the lifecycle of a proposal:

 * Fork this repo and create a pull-request with your proposal following the
   [template in the design folder](design/_TEMPLATE.md). Name the file 
   `###-rfc-title.md` (do not assign a number yet).

 * ...
